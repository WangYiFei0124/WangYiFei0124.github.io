# Research Experiences
**Text-Image Alignment in Vision-Language Models**  
_University of Maryland, College Park_  
_July 2024 - Present_  

_Advisor: Furong Huang, Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland_

- Identified concept misalignment in vision-language models and hypothesized that continuous image representations and discrete text embeddings lead to poor modality alignment
- Developed a feature quantization method by designing codebooks to map image vectors to clustering centers in the subspace, which successfully improved the alignment of images and texts     in discrete space
- Addressed information loss by integrating a quantization reconstruction loss into the loss function, will publish findings as the first co-author in ICCV 

**ADHD Diagnosis Based on Multi-Modal MRI Data**  
_Tongji University_  
_Apr 2024 - Present_  
_Advisor: Chunyan Duan, Associate Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering, Tongji University_

- Fine-tuned MedicalNet, a pre-trained medical model by Tencent, to extract image feature from MRI to ensure robustness in spite of limited patient cases
- Addressed overfitting by calculating functional statistical indicators ALFF and ReHo from MRI and jointly training these metrics with image features, upgrading diagnostic accuracy from     77% to 80% 

**Integration of External Knowledge into Large Language Models**  
_Tongji University_  
_Dec 2023 - Apr 2024_  
_Advisor: Qingwen Liu, Professor at College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University_
